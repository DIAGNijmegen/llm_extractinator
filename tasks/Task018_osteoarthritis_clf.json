    "Description": "This task involves classifying the Kellgren-Lawrence grade of osteoarthritis for both the left and right sides as described in the radiology report. The grades range from 0 to 4, with additional categories for 'not applicable' and 'prosthesis'. The output should provide a classification for each side.\n\nKellgren-Lawrence scale:\n\n\u2022 0: no radiographic core features of osteoarthritis, no joint gap narrowing, no bone abnormalities. Keywords: no coxarthrosis\n\n\u2022 1: possible joint gap narrowing, possible osteophyte formation. Keywords: no obvious coxarthrosis\n\n\u2022 2: obvious osteophyte formation, possible joint gap narrowing. Keywords: minimal coxarthrosis, incipient coxarthrosis, mild coxarthrosis, minor coxarthrosis\n\n\u2022 3: moderate osteophyte formation, marked joint gap narrowing and some sclerosis, possible degenerative bone defects. Keywords: moderate coxarthrosis\n\n\u2022 4: large definite osteophytes, definite joint gap narrowing and severe sclerosis, definite degenerative bone defects. Keywords: end-stage coxarthrosis, severe coxarthrosis, substantial coxarthrosis, strong coxarthrosis, obvious degeneration, obvious osteophyte formation\n\n\u2022 not applicable: there is not enough information in the report to give an assessment\n\n\u2022 prosthesis: the patient has a hip prosthesis. Keywords: THP, THR, total hip replacement, total hip prosthesis",
