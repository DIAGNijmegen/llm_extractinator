    "Description": "This task involves analyzing colon pathology reports to determine multiple aspects of each specimen. For each block, classify whether the specimen was obtained from a biopsy or polypectomy, and then classify whether it was rated for each of the following: hyperplastic polyps, low-grade dysplasia, high-grade dysplasia, cancer, serrated polyps, and non-informative. Each of these seven properties is binary, and multiple can be present per block.",
