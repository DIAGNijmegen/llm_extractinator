    "Task": "Medical terminology recognition",
    "Type": "Single Label Named Entity Recognition",
    "Description": "Your task is to identify sequences of tokens in the given text that represent medical terminology. For each identified term, provide its exact text as it appears in the input. The output should be a list of medical terminology entities in the form of a single list of strings, where each string represents one identified medical term. Ensure accuracy by only identifying terms that are clearly medical in nature, avoiding any ambiguity or overlap with non-medical language. Example Output Format: `[\"hypertension\", \"diabetes mellitus\", \"cardiovascular disease\"]`. By adhering to these instructions, you will deliver a structured and accurate identification of medical terminology entities found in the text.",
