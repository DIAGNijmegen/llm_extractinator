    "Task": "Estimate the diameter of the largest pulmonary nodule described in the radiology report in mm.",
    "Type": "Regression",
    "Description": "This task involves estimating the diameter of the largest pulmonary nodule described in the radiology report, with the diameter given in millimeters. When multiple sizes are described for a single lesion (e.g., the short and long axis), the size for that lesion should be averaged.",
