    "Task": "Prostate biopsy sampling",
    "Type": "Multi Label Named Entity Recognition",
    "Description": "This task involves analyzing prostate biopsy reports to identify and classify sequences of words that describe the location of each numbered biopsy and to determine whether the lesion sampling was representative, not representative, or ambiguous. The full text should be returned with tags surrounding the identified entities. Use <START LOCATION 1> and <END LOCATION 1> for the first biopsy location, <START LOCATION 2> and <END LOCATION 2> for the second biopsy location, and so on. It can be the case that multiple numbered biopsies have to be tagged at the same time. In that case, use for example <START LOCATION 2+3> and <END LOCATION 2+3>. If the quality of the biopsy regards number 1, use <START REPRESENTATIVE 1> and <END REPRESENTATIVE 1> for representative sampling, <START NOT REPRESENTATIVE 1> and <END NOT REPRESENTATIVE 1> for non-representative sampling, and <START AMBIGUOUS 1> and <END AMBIGUOUS 1> for ambiguous sampling. The same goes for the other biopsy numbers.",
