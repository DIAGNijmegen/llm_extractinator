    "Task": "RECIST lesion size measurement",
    "Type": "Regression",
    "Description": "This task involves estimating the size of each of the up to 5 RECIST target lesions described in the radiology report, with the size given in millimeters. For lymph nodes, the short axis should be reported. If less than 5 lesions are described, the remaining lesion sizes should be set to 0.",
